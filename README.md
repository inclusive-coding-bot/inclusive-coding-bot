Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This bot was written as part of a course project to increase inclusion in Computer Science. The goal was to assist maintainers in transitioning to gender neutral language through automatically creating PRs with substitutions like the following:

Unfortunately, at the current iteration of the bot, the rate of false positives / incorrect substitutions was too high for the bot to continue running. As such, at this time, **the bot is DISABLED**.

We hope make the bot more context aware using some form of NPL, and re-releasing it as a GitHub App or linter that maintainers may opt into using if they choose to.

If you have any specific feedback, please submit it [here](https://forms.gle/YXd3Rbx18g4yKKCv9).
