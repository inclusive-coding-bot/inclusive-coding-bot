Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This bot was written to help open source GitHub repositories transition into using gender neutral language to create an inclusive environment. The goal was to automatically perform substitutions like the following:

Unfortunately, at the current iteration of the bot, the rate of false positives / incorrect substitutions was too high for the bot to continue running. As such, at this time, **the bot is DISABLED**.

We hope make the bot more context aware using some form of NPL, and releasing it as a GitHub App or linter that maintainers may opt into using if they choose to.

If you have any specific feedback, please submit it [here](https://forms.gle/YXd3Rbx18g4yKKCv9).
